This is our first English-Vietnamese dictionary app. We used Java language for the coding part and JavaFX with the support of SceneBuilder to make the GUI part. We also used CSS for further styling.  

**retarDict** has basic features of a dictionary app: finding words, showing pronunciation and meaning of the word, pronouncing feature using TTS library, adding your words, translating and CAT GENERATOR!!! (it's because we both love cats). It also has dark mode and different accent colours. So what are you waiting for, give it a try and find out why it's called retarDict!!!
