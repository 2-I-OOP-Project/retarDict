This is our first English-Vietnamese dictionary app. We used Java language for the coding part and JavaFX with the support of SceneBuilder to make the GUI part. We also used CSS for further styling.  

**retarDict** has basic features of a dictionry app: find word, show pronunciation and meaning of the word, pronounce feature using TTS library, add your words, translating and CAT GENERATOR!!! (it's because we both love cats). It also has dark mode and different accent colors. So what are you waiting for, give it a try and find out why it's called retarDict!!!
